*Explaining the fancy words in software industry*

## `Global`

- **Fire/Call/Trigger :** you will see these words a lot and everywhere, it just means execute a function.

- **Compile :** Compiler transforms code written in a high-level programming language into the machine code, at once (all code in a file), before program runs.

- **Interpreter :** Converts each high-level program statement (instruction/code block... whatever), one by one, into the machine code, during program run.

- **Transpile :** Convert the syntax of one programming language to another. That's it.

- **High-level programming :** its simply a programming language that is human readable and easy to write, read and maintain. Examples of high level languages are C, C++, Java, Python, etc.

- **Low-level programming :** its programming language that is machine friendly, It is tough to understand and complex to maintain, It is not commonly used now-a-days in programming. so rest ðŸ˜…

- **Unit Test :** its nothing but testing your code. for example testing functions if they are working and returning values you expect.

- **Stream / Data stream... :** simply means data being sent somewhere (e.g, to a server) over time. A stream can be thought of as items on a conveyor belt being processed one at a time rather than in large batches.

- **Buffer :** A buffer contains data that is stored for a short amount of time, typically in the computer's memory (RAM). The purpose of a buffer is to hold data right before it is used. For example, when you download an audio or video file from the Internet, it may load the first 20% of it into a buffer and then begin to play.

- **Server :** its just a machine, a computer like yours that have an OS, a RAM a CPU... that stores your source code (files) and runs it.

- **Client :** client in software has many meanings, but in general it means the consumer, it can be the browser (wich is you) it can be any thing that consume or use a software.

- **Web Server :** It can be a Software or Hardware (a computer/machine) that runs websites, it just takes your button click and deliver it to the server (the code you write) and get the response back to you (who clicked that button)

- **Computing :** Computing is any activity that uses computers to manage, process, and communicate information. It includes development of both hardware and software.

- **API :** its nothing but a web server (code you write e.g: using Nodejs, Python...) that respond to user requests (e.g: creating an account) with Fail or Success messages.

- **Vanilla / Pure :** its just refers to the pure/parent programming language.

- **Anonymous :** its just a function that doesn't have a name, e.g: ``` const foo = function() { ... } ```, python example ``` bar = lambda x, y : ... ``` 

----


## `js`

- **Closures :** Its just a function that returns a function.

- **Single-threaded :** means the execution of single code instruction at a time.

- **Hoisting :**

- **Event Loop :**

- **Execution Context :**

- **Execution Stack :**

- **Callbacks :**

- **Scope :**

- **Synchronous :**

- **Asynchronous :**

- **Primitve Types :**

- **Functional Programming :**

- **Immediately Invoked Functions (IIFEs) :**


## `GO`

- **Concurrency :**
